Q.1 Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout?
Answer:
setTimeout callbacks are executed before any I/O callbacks, but sometimes we might have case 
to run callbacks after finishing I/O eventhandlers. At that time we should use setImmediate, 
which queues the callbacks immediately after the last I/O handler.

Q.2 Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate ?
Answer:
setImmediate queues the callbacks only after the last I/O callbacks is executed
A function passed to process.nextTick() is going to be executed on the current iteration of the event loop, after the current operation ends. This means it will always execute before setImmediate.
